This exercise gives you practice with ES2015-style import/export.  
So that we can work with import/export, we’ll use ***create-react-app*** to get a starter skeleton. However, we won’t be building an actual React app.  
So: start by deleting everything inside of the `src/ directory`, and then doing your work inside of this now-empty directory.  

**`$ npx create-react-app react-modules-fruit`**

## Requirements
For this assignment you should create three JavaScript files:  

**`src/helpers.js`**  
This file should export two array helper functions:  
- ***choice(items):*** returns a randomly selected item from array of items. 
- ***remove(items, item):*** removes the first matching item from items, if item exists, and returns it. Otherwise returns undefined.

**`src/foods.js`**  
This file should export this array of fruits:

`let fruits = [
  "🍇", "🍈", "🍉", "🍊", "🍋", "🍌", "🍍", "🍎",
  "🍏", "🍐", "🍒", "🍓", "🥝", "🍅", "🥑"
]`

**`src/index.js`**  
This file should import the fruits and both array helpers. It should then:  
- Randomly draw a fruit from the array.  
- Log the message “I’d like one RANDOMFRUIT, please.”  
- Log the message “Here you go: RANDOMFRUIT”. 
- Log the message “Delicious! May I have another?  
- Remove the fruit from the array of fruits  
- Log the message “I’m sorry, we’re all out. We have FRUITSLEFT left.”

## Testing This
Run this with `npm start` and you should see something like this in your browser console:  
`I'd like one 🍉, please. 
Here you go: 🍉. 
Delicious! May I have another?  
I'm sorry, we're all out. We have 14 left.`
